# Instructions
Either download the release executable from the releases page (top of the page) or download the source package and run Infoscreen.py with a python intepreter.
Any suggestions or feature requests can be forwarded to kari.vatjusanttila [{at}] gmail.com

# Deployment
I used pyinstaller to create a runnable exe in Windows. Usage: pyinstaller --onefile InfoScreen.py or just pyinstaller InfoScreen.py if you don't want to package the program into a single file (might cause problems in some setups)
