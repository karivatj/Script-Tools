# OuluHealth-Data-Miner

A script that fetches newest events from OuluHealth webpage and outputs them to a file. This can be used for ex on a infoscreen to display information about the current events. Ouluhealth does not offer an RSS feed so this kind of script is necessary to rip information from the website.
